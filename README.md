# project_portfolio

This repository contains a curated set of data science notebooks demonstrating end-to-end analytical workflows, from data cleaning and validation to exploratory analysis and insight generation. Each notebook is designed to be portfolio ready, emphasizing clarity, reproducibility, and real-world decision making relevance rather than exhaustive modeling.

The projects below highlight applied skills in data wrangling, feature engineering, time series analysis, and business analytics using real datasets.

**NYC Airbnb Data Cleaning**

Notebook: `notebooks/01_nyc_airbnb_data_cleaning.ipynb`

This notebook demonstrates a production-style data cleaning workflow, including:
- before/after missingness checks
- schema and type verification
- explicit data validation
- lightweight sanity-check visualization

The focus is on pipeline correctness and downstream readiness rather than full EDA.

**Supply Usage Analysis**  
Notebook: `notebooks/supply_usage_analysis.ipynb`

This notebook analyzes retail and warehouse inventory usage over time, focusing on:
- multi-channel usage metric construction  
- monthly time series aggregation  
- supplier- and category-level usage patterns  
- identification of top-moving items and seasonal trends  

The emphasis is on practical EDA and decision-oriented insights for inventory and demand planning.
